## The Manifesto

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple" icon=false}
### 🛑 Stop Treating Your Computer Like a Magic Box

Digital Humanities is not just about reading books on a screen. It's about using computational methods to ask new questions. But you cannot ask those questions if you are afraid of the machine.

**We believe that:**

1.  **"It just works" is a lie.** When things "just work," you learn nothing. When they break, you learn how they work. Embrace the error message.
2.  **The Command Line is not scary.** It is simply a conversation. It is the most direct way to speak to your machine without the "user friendly" translation layer getting in the way.
3.  **File management is scholarship.** If you lose your data, you have no research. If you cannot find your sources, you have no argument. Organizing your digital life is as crucial as organizing your bibliography.
4.  **You belong here.** Technical skills are not a gene you are born with. They are a practice. You are a scholar; you can learn this.

## Why This Exists

This guide emerged from a recurring pattern in Digital Humanities classrooms: students who are brilliant at critical theory and close reading but get stuck because they don't know where their files are saved.

We skip the "Introduction to Computer Science" theory and focus strictly on the **survival skills** you need to do DH work:
- How to navigate without a mouse.
- How to keep your data safe.
- How to fix things when they break.

## What You'll Learn

### 🏗️ Fundamentals
- **File Management**: Stop saving everything to "Desktop".
- **File Paths**: Understand where your data actually lives.
- **Formats**: Why `.docx` is the enemy of data analysis.
- **Encoding**: Why your text turned into ``.

### 🛠️ Practical Skills
- **Command Line**: Navigate your computer like a pro.
- **Compression**: Handle archives and datasets.
- **Version Control**: Stop naming files `final_final_v2.doc`.
- **Troubleshooting**: Read error messages without panicking.
