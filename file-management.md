# File Management Fundamentals

File management is the foundation of effective digital humanities work. Poor file organization leads to lost research, duplicated effort, and frustration. This guide will help you develop habits that will serve you throughout your academic and professional career.

## Why File Management Matters for DH Students

In digital humanities, you'll work with:
- Multiple versions of text files and datasets
- Research notes and drafts
- Images, audio, and video files
- Code and scripts
- Collaboration materials shared with team members

Good file management ensures you can always find what you need and that your work is reproducible and shareable.

## Core Principles

### 1. Consistent Naming Conventions
**Good naming habits save hours of searching later.**

#### File Naming Best Practices
- Use descriptive names: `medieval-manuscript-transcription-draft-2024-09-26.txt` not `document1.txt`
- Use hyphens or underscores instead of spaces: `research_notes.txt` not `research notes.txt`
- Include dates in YYYY-MM-DD format for version control: `2024-09-26_interview-transcript.txt`
- Use consistent capitalization (recommend lowercase for compatibility)

#### Platform-Specific Considerations

**Mac Users:**
- File names are case-sensitive in some contexts, case-insensitive in others
- Avoid special characters: / : < > | * ? "
- Maximum filename length: 255 characters

**PC Users:**
- File names are case-insensitive
- Avoid special characters: \ / : * ? " < > |
- Maximum filename length: 260 characters (including full path)

### 2. Folder Structure and Hierarchy

Create a logical, consistent folder structure that makes sense for your work.

#### Recommended DH Project Structure
```
Your-DH-Project/
├── 01-raw-data/
│   ├── texts/
│   ├── images/
│   └── metadata/
├── 02-processed-data/
│   ├── cleaned-texts/
│   └── analysis-ready/
├── 03-analysis/
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── outputs/
├── 04-documentation/
│   ├── research-notes/
│   └── methodology/
├── 05-drafts/
└── 06-final-outputs/
```

#### Benefits of This Structure
- **Numbered folders** ensure consistent ordering across platforms
- **Descriptive names** make purpose clear
- **Separation by stage** prevents confusion between raw and processed data
- **Documentation folder** keeps important notes accessible

### 3. Version Control Through Naming

Until you learn formal version control (Git), use naming conventions:

#### For Documents
- `paper-draft-v1.docx`
- `paper-draft-v2.docx`
- `paper-draft-final.docx`
- `paper-draft-final-FINAL.docx` (we've all been there!)

#### Better Approach with Dates
- `paper-draft-2024-09-26.docx`
- `paper-draft-2024-10-03.docx`
- `paper-draft-2024-10-15-submitted.docx`

## Platform-Specific File Management

### Mac File Management

#### Using Finder Effectively
1. **View Options**: Use List view (⌘+2) for detailed file info
2. **Column View** (⌘+3): Great for navigating deep folder structures
3. **Tags**: Color-code files by project or status
4. **Smart Folders**: Create saved searches for file types or dates

#### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts
- `⌘+Space`: Open Spotlight search
- `⌘+Shift+G`: Go to specific folder path
- `⌘+I`: Get info on selected file
- `⌘+Delete`: Move to Trash

#### Pro Tips for Mac Users
- Use **Stacks** on Desktop to auto-organize files by type
- Enable **filename extensions** in Finder preferences
- Use **AirDrop** for easy file sharing between Mac devices

### PC File Management

#### Using File Explorer Effectively
1. **Details View**: Shows file size, type, and modification date
2. **Quick Access**: Pin frequently used folders
3. **Ribbon Interface**: Access file operations quickly
4. **Search**: Use search operators like `type:pdf` or `modified:today`

#### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Windows+E`: Open File Explorer
- `Ctrl+Shift+N`: Create new folder
- `F2`: Rename selected file
- `Alt+Enter`: File properties

#### Pro Tips for PC Users
- Use **Libraries** to group related folders from different locations
- Enable **file extensions** in View options
- Use **OneDrive** integration for cloud storage and sync

## Common File Management Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Desktop Dumping
**Problem**: Saving everything to the desktop
**Solution**: Use desktop only for temporary files; move to proper folders daily

### 2. Generic Folder Names
**Problem**: Folders named "Stuff," "Misc," "New Folder"
**Solution**: Always use descriptive names that indicate content

### 3. Deep Folder Nesting
**Problem**: Folders buried 8+ levels deep
**Solution**: Keep structure 3-5 levels deep maximum

### 4. Inconsistent Naming
**Problem**: Mixing naming conventions within a project
**Solution**: Establish conventions early and stick to them

### 5. No Backup Strategy
**Problem**: Keeping only one copy of important files
**Solution**: Follow the 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite)

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Audit Your Current System
1. Take a screenshot of your desktop
2. Count how many files are directly on your desktop
3. Open your Documents folder and identify folders with generic names
4. Make a list of improvements needed

### Exercise 2: Create a DH Project Structure
1. Create a new folder for a hypothetical DH project
2. Set up the recommended folder structure
3. Practice moving files into appropriate folders
4. Create sample files with proper naming conventions

### Exercise 3: Clean Up Existing Files
1. Choose one messy folder on your computer
2. Rename files using consistent conventions
3. Create appropriate subfolders
4. Move files to logical locations

## Advanced Tips

### Metadata and File Properties
Both Mac and PC allow you to add metadata to files:
- **Tags/Keywords**: For easy searching
- **Comments**: Brief descriptions of file contents
- **Custom properties**: Project names, authors, etc.

### Automation Tools
- **Mac**: Use Automator for repetitive file tasks
- **PC**: Use PowerToys or batch renaming tools
- **Both**: Consider tools like Hazel (Mac) or File Juggler (PC) for automatic file organization

## Questions for Reflection

1. How much time do you currently spend looking for files?
2. What types of files do you work with most in your DH projects?
3. How do you currently handle different versions of the same document?
4. What file management habits from this guide would help you most?

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered basic file management, you're ready to learn about [file paths and navigation](./file-paths.md), which will help you understand exactly where your well-organized files live on your computer.
